# Seminar: Lean

## Meeting 2

### progress

* finished the Natural Number Game
* started to look into the lean4game (needs a docker container on the server to run lean)
* started/ finished with the second tutorial game
* started with "lean theorem prover" tutorial

### more possible ideas

* use a nontrivial proof to show how lean works in the mathematics section
* game possibly about propositional logic, see [euredeka.com](euredeka.com) -> launch application(login) -> logic

### topics for next few weeks

* do more tutorials

we decided to split up and work on different topics

| name | topic |
| -- | -- |
| Sebastian | lean history |
| Nikita | lean in type theory  |
| Frederick | setting up lean4game |

## Meeting 1

### possible topics

* applications in mathmatics
* applications in computer science
* history

### possible structure

1. Introduction
2. History of Theorem Provers
3. Current State of Lean
4. Applications:
   1. Mathematics
   2. Computer Science
   3. Teaching
5. Outro

### other ideas

* short interactive example of using lean for program correctness with the js library

### possible todos for next week

* finish/ continue with the Natural Number Game
* look into the js library
* look at use cases of lean
* setup lean on own pc (lean 3 prob)
* brainstorm more ideas
* whatever else comes to mind
