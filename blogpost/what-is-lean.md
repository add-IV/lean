[Lean](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/lean/) is a functional programming language and an interactive theorem prover.
Lean was developed at Microsoft Research in 2013. The idea behind Lean was to help mathematicians and engineers solve complex mathematical problems. Lean has a small, trusted kernel based on dependent type theory. Lean aims to bridge the gap between automated and interactive theorem proving by allowing automated tools in an interactive framework. It is a long-term effort and an open-source project with an active community, hosted on GitHub. The Lean community is actively contributing to Lean's mathematical library, Mathlib and has already digitized half of the undergrad curriculum. The two goals are to be done with the undergraded curriculum in less than 10 years and to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. Lean provides a platform for software verification and development, formalizing mathematics and education. Lean 4 is the latest version.
Recently, a Lean team was able to help Field Medalist Peter Scholze confirm a theorem.
