Lean has an active community that is trying to formalize all of mathematics into a repository of formalized mathematics proofs called [mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib). It has a wide range of mathematical topics like number theory, analysis, topology, and more. Everyone can contribute to this open-source project.
The goal of mathlib is to provide a reliable foundation of formalized mathematics that can be used in research, education and formal verification.

Mathlib does not only have elementary proofs, it also contains modern proofs such as the theorem of liquid vector spaces by Peter Scholze. He posed [a challenge](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01627-2) to formalize this theorem and on the 14th July 2022, a year and a half after the challenge, [mathlib announced](https://leanprover-community.github.io/blog/posts/lte-final/) that they successfully formalized the theorem.
