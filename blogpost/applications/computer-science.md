Lean can be used to verify not just mathematical proofs but also programs. (Keyword: [Curry-Howard correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence)) For example, it can be used to verify the correctness of a [small compiler](https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1613286/FULLTEXT01.pdf). As the entire compiler has been written in Lean, it is possible to verify the compiler with great confidence. It is also possible to verify smaller algorithms in Lean, as it is possible to implement them quite easily. For example, list-reversing-algorithms that work inductively can be verified in Lean.
