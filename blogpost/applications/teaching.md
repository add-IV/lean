Lean can be used to teach logic. This has been demonstrated by [the Natural Number Game](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/), which introduces users to the Lean syntax by teaching them about induction and simpler propositional logic proofs.

There is also the github repository [Formalising Mathematics](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/formalising-mathematics) which teaches various math theorems by using Lean. It is a 8 week workshop that gets harder over time. Topics vary from propositional logic to analysis and group cohomology.

Theorem provers have also been used in the past by various [professors in lectures](https://youtu.be/Y7blCeETJo8?t=2176https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7blCeETJo8&t=801s).
