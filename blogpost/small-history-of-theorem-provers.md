The earliest work on computer-assisted proof was in the 1950s. The first theorem provers were automated theorem provers (ATP), which are theorem provers that were supposed to prove an assertion fully automatically. Later, the idea came up for a more interactive arrangement where the user guided the proof. In order to guide a machine proof, there needs to be a language for the user to communicate the proof to the machine. Today, there are many theorem provers out there; some names you can recognize are Coq, HOL, Isabelle, etc. Some cornerstones for interactive theorem proving are Automath, LCF, Minzar and Martin-l√∂f type theory.
