In the world of computer science and mathematics, type theory plays a crucial role as a formal system for classifying data into different types and defining valid operations on those types. Unlike traditional set theory that relies on axioms for defining sets and their properties, type theory utilizes rules of inference to reason about the relationships between types and terms - it does not need any axioms for an underlying implementation such as sets.

It was first created by Bertrand Russell in the 20th century because of foundational issues in set theory. Russell's paradox highlighted the need for more rigorous foundations in mathematics.

A main advantage of type theory is that everything, and I mean EVERYTHING: terms, functions, propositions, has a type. The [Curry-Howard correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence) established a link between computer science and type theory by showing us that there is a one-to-one correspondence between proofs and programs or propositions and types.

This means that any proof can be theoretically represented as a program, and conversely, programs can also be used to extract proofs - something of high importance in the field of proof-carrying code. New avenues have been opened by this link between logic and computer science, as it is now possible to verify the correctness of a program or proof using a richly-typed language. This verification is only possible due to the unique property of most type theory models being intuitionistic. This intuitionistic foundation makes it a great candidate for theorem provers, which use computational aspects in their approach, which would be difficult to implement in systems with non-constructive proofs.
