A mathematical proof has two roles to fill: first, it convinces the reader that the statement is correct, and second, it explains why the proof is correct and the underlying ideas. 
A mathematical proof is constructed in small steps that can be verified easily. Mathematicians are in this regard  sometimes lazy and skip proof steps because those are "definitely" true. But sometimes theorems are false, such that a "trivial" small step couldn't be verified. 
With that in mind, it can be even worse because when a wrong statement of a theorem is used in another proof, it is like pulling at the bottom card of a card house; it collapses.
Getting back to the two roles of a proof, a theorem prover can not help us explain the proof or even explain the underlying ideas, but a theorem prover is definitely able to help us verify the correctness of a proof by trying to check mechanically that the theorem is true, and by doing so, we transform a previous informal proof into a formal proof. 
That is not an easy task because a proof in a textbook is not something a machine can understand, so a translation from an informal proof, which is written in a natural language, is a tedious job to do.
